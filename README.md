# PyramidFlow Docker

The PyramidFlow project focuses on video generation using a pyramidal flow-matching technique, designed for training efficiency. It aims to create realistic, high-quality video content through an autoregressive approach that incrementally refines video frames in a multi-level, pyramid-like structure. The project showcases examples like cinematic scenes, nature shots, and detailed movements, highlighting its ability to generate both simple and complex scenarios from text or image inputs.
